Hello, everyone, glad you're here.

This one, right here, is a post to kickstart my blog about things that interest me. I mean Game Design and Storytelling. 

I will leave some half-baked ideas about games and stories I have along the way here. And than I will describe the ups and downs I'll go through with some kind of an actual implementation. Ideally, some of these will help me to build some kind of a design portfolio. But to be fair, I just want to have fun doing what I like.
