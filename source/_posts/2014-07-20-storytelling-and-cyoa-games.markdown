It means "Choose Your Own Adventure". 

In my early childhood, I remember, I had a number of books like this. Each page ended with a passage in the spirit of "If you think the hero will say YES, go to page X, if you think he will say NO, page - XX." And the story on these two pages had drastically different developments.

The reason I bring this up today is simple. I noticed some games on Steam surfacing with that *CYOA* tag, selling copies and stirring the forum discussions on whether they are really games and if they are worthy of their price.
